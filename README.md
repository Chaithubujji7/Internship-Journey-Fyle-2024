## 🔹 Application and Assignment
Guess what? I'm in the final semester of my Computer Engineering journey, and let me tell you about this wild ride with Fyle!

So, I was on the lookout for an internship to level up my skills during my 7th semester. Found this place called Fyle on Internshala. They had this super cool Frontend Engineering Internship, but get this - they only had 4 spots, and over 1300 people applied! 😱

I decided to give it a shot, applied, and to my surprise, Fyle replied in just two days! They gave me a task: create a GitHub Repositories listing page using Angular 14+. Cool, right?

Here's the catch – I had never used Angular before. I usually roll with vanilla JS and React, but hey, let's learn Angular in just 7 days! 😅 I found this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1BztTYDF-QNlGo5-g65Xj1mINHYk_FM9&feature=shared) and started my Angular journey.

Now, the fun part! With only 3 days left to build the app, I had zero time for fancy designs. So, I took a blank page and drew a basic outline of my application. Funny, right? But that sketch really saved me during the interview (I'll spill the beans on that later).

Fast forward 7 days, and voila! Check out the frontend web application I created for the assignment: [My Application](https://fyle-internship-challenge-23-sahilk-027.vercel.app/).

Submitted it through a Google form and now playing the waiting game for their response. Exciting times ahead! 😇

## 🔹 Interviews
Alrighty, Amigos, gather 'round for the next chapter of my Fyle internship adventure! The interview at Fyle, Imagine it like having a chat about your favorite video game with a friend who's really good at it!

### The Epic Wait
After sending in my assignment, the waiting began. And oh boy, did I have to wait... for a whole week! But then, like a beacon of hope, an email arrived from one of the engineers at the Fyle team. They wanted to chat with me! 🎉

### Round 1: The Techie Talk
We started by talking about Fyle and what the engineers do there. Then, the fun part began - the technical stuff! They asked me questions about how I make THE THINGS on the internet (front-end development, as they call it). We talked about my assignment. And guess what? My sketches came to the rescue! I explained my code using those doodles, and it worked like magic! ✨

Now, here's the exciting part. They wanted to see any one of my past projects! I was so excited that I showed not just one, but TWO of my coolest projects - [Trinity-2023](https://trinity-2023.vercel.app/) and [AssembleScript](https://assemblescript.vercel.app/). Cleared this round easily!

### Round 2: The Chill Chat
Next up, round two – the Non-techy + a dash of Tech. We talked about my personality, how I see startups, my portfolio and some projects I tackled before. It was more like a friendly phone call than a serious interview. Can you believe it lasted an hour? But hey, it was all about sharing ideas and learning about each other. 😄

### Round 3: The Unexpected Round
Picture this: after two rounds of cool chats, I thought my job interview adventure was coming to an end. But surprise, surprise - there was a third-round waiting for me! That's why I call it the Unexpected Round. 

Here we talked about the awesome things Fyle offers to its workers and some cool perks, like extra treats in your lunchbox. It was different from the first two rounds. No tricky tech questions, instead, we talked about why Fyle? and what kind of cool things they do for their team members.

And just like that, the Unexpected Round was over. It was a bit surprising because usually at Fyle, people have two rounds, but Fyle threw in an extra one for a twist. They wanted to make sure I'd be a happy camper at Fyle, and that's how the Unexpected Round became a little surprise in my job interview adventure! 🌟😄

## 🔹 First Day at Fyle - Onboarding Adventure 🌟
Let's move a little further, fellow travellers...(Yeah you are travelling this journey with me so far 😇)! Today marked the commencement of my internship at Fyle. The onboarding process kicked off with a delightful meeting with Yitzhak from the People Success team. In our scheduled call, he told me about the perks and benefits showered upon Fyle interns.

### Perks and Benefits 🍔

Fyle goes above and beyond to ensure interns have a stellar experience. Some highlights include:

- Glamorous Gear: Interns are equipped with Apple MacBooks, the epitome of geekiness in the tech world. Talk about coding in style!
- Fuel for Thought: Food and internet reimbursement, because well-fed brains code better. It's science, right?
- Knowledge Boost: Yitzhak pointed me towards essential security and professional training courses to finish within the first week. A proactive approach to skill development!
- Health First: Fyle acknowledges the importance of well-being by providing interns with their own health insurance coverage. Healthy interns, happy interns!

### Unique Work Culture 🌈

Here's the scoop on Fyle's work culture – they don't have an HR team! Why? Because at Fyle, people are not just resources; they are valued individuals. A refreshing perspective in the corporate landscape.

### Leave Policy 🏝️

Hold on to your hats – Fyle boasts a leave policy that's as cool as an Ice 🥶. Annual 20 leaves and unlimited sick leaves 😲. And get this, they actually encourage people to take leaves! Who would've thought that? 😲

### Meet the Team 🤝

Next on the agenda was meeting my manager, "Dimple." We delved into work, discussed about the codebase, and explored a mix of technical and non-technical topics.

But wait, there's more! I also got introduced to my "Buddy," a lifeline in the world of Fyle. Aniruddha is my go-to person for any queries or questions that may arise during this exciting journey.

And there you have it, the highlights of my first day at Fyle. Buckle up, as this internship journey promises more adventures, challenges, and aha moments! 🌟
